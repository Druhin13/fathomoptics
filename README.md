# What is Fathom Optics?

Fathom Optics (formerly LUMI) transitioned from virtual reality to printing labels with depth & motion. Brands, designers, and printing press operators can visualize and create impressive video prints for labels & packaging, using their design platform. With their Light Field technology, they aim to transform the printing, packaging, and graphic design industries.

They came to Brandathon to revamp their core design and copywriting.

## What is Brandathon?

Brandathon is a weekend-long branding hackathon featuring creatives from the worlds of design, copy, and strategy competing to rebrand early-stage startups that are being mentored by iconic founders, creative directors, and angel investors.  
  
Brandathon usually has 2 different startups with 2 different creative teams competing against each other. But this time, it was a head-to-head battle between 2 teams designing for the same company (Fathom Optics).  
And the team with the better redesign wins the Brandathon.  
(Spoiler alert - We won ðŸ¤£)
