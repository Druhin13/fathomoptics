# What is Fathom Optics?

Fathom Optics (formerly LUMII) transitioned from virtual reality to printing labels with depth & motion. Brands, designers, and printing press operators can visualize and create impressive video prints for labels & packaging, using their design platform. With their Light Field technology, they aim to transform the printing, packaging, and graphic design industries.

They came to Brandathon to revamp their core design and copywriting.

## What is Brandathon?

Brandathon is a weekend-long branding hackathon featuring creatives from the worlds of design, copy, and strategy competing to rebrand early-stage startups that are being mentored by iconic founders, creative directors, and angel investors.  
  
Brandathon usually has 2 different startups with 2 different creative teams competing against each other. But this time, it was a head-to-head battle between 2 teams designing for the same company (Fathom Optics).  
And the team with the better redesign wins the Brandathon.  
(Spoiler alert - We won ðŸ¤£)

## Team & TImeline :


Collaborated with 3 different creatives specializing in branding, creative strategy, and copywriting in a 48 hours rebranding session. We came together to design various deliverables for 'Fathom Optics' consisting of the copywriting strategy, brand identity, investor pitch deck, and a redesigned landing page.

# Exploration Phase


As our first step, we spoke with the Fathom team to ensure that we understand exactly what the product offers and how it helps its users while designing for print & packaging. Our meeting ended with a discussion of the deliverables they wanted, and here are the details.  
  
- Brand Guidelines (colors and fonts, tone direction, manifesto)  
- Web Design (new structure, updated copy, visual elements)  
- Pitch Deck (for potential investors)  
- Communication strategy

We created a rough timeline, and divided the work amongst ourselves, in order to save time. Day 1 was mostly spent on researching and brainstorming design ideas for Fathom Optics.

We decided to create mood boards exploring color, typography, web layouts and show our ideas to the Fathom team, and see if we were on the same page or not. Me, Fer & Therese went to create those mood boards, while Reagan started working on the brand manifesto.

We presented our mood boards along with the rough branding manifesto to Fathom on our second meeting and asked their opinion on them.

# Brand Guidelines

Our design preferences were further honed after we noted down the feedback from the Fathom team. And for the next step, Fer and Therese started to work on the color palette and typography that would form the foundation of the brand guidelines.  
  
For the color palette, we stayed with the traditional CMYK color scheme the brand already had, as well as two additional neutrals - a Soft white and a Matte black.  
  
For typography, the original decision was to maintain a sans serif font for the entire project in order to convey simplicity and modernity. But while showing modernity, we also wanted to convey the brand's traditional roots to print. And so we decided to use both Serif and Sans-Serif. Serif for headings, and Sans-Serif for the copy heavy paragraphs.  
  
  
At the same time that the Brand Guidelines were being designed, Reagan was already working on the website copy, which will help me get started on the website, for the next phase of designing.

# Web Audit

In order to improve upon the old landing page that Fathom Optics had, I analyzed and did a web audit of their site before the end of Day 1, in order to get a head start on Day 2 when designing the website.  
  
The web audit included the following three aspects:  
Design, Usability, and Performance of the website.
<br>
## Design

There were a lot of accessibility issues throughout the entire website. For starters, background and foreground elements with texts didn't have a sufficient contrast ratio. There were multiple instances where text overlapped over background video without an overlay and thus making it illegible to read. A lack of consistent typography along with mixed alignment issues made it even harder to read the big chunk of texts.  
  
Although the website was responsive, yet there were multiple issues with the mobile design. The website display was not optimized for large screen monitors and thereby made it practically unusable.  
  
Despite taking so long to load the multimedia files, the background videos could not even be viewed properly on mobile devices.
<br>
## Usability

I used Jakob Nielsen's heuristic evaluation to check the usability of the old website, and here are the things that I found out:

1. **Visibility of system status -**
	Users see a blank screen until the page loads fully. There is no feedback for the user when clicking the Sign-Up, Contact, and other CTA buttons. 
	
2. **Match between system and the real world**  

3. **User control and freedom -**
Once going to a page inside the website, there's no way to get back to the homepage.  
4. **Consistency and standards -**
Mixed usage of button hover design for multiple instances. The logo in the top left doesn't take you to the homepage, and this breaks the consistent web design convention, which also prevents users from ever returning to the homepage.  
5. **Error prevention -**
Textboxes do not provide feedback on internal errors, nor do they help the user prevent them.  
6. **Recognition rather than recall -**
The contact form asks users to provide their phone numbers, by breaking them into pieces. The phone number form has a 'Country' tag with a numeric text box to fill it up.  
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use -**
When a page is scrolled, the menu cannot be accessed without returning to the top of the page. Neither does the page have a button to take users to the top of the page easily.  
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design**  
9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors -**
 The website does handle page errors by redirecting to a separate page and telling the users what went wrong without any technical jargon. However, it does not provide any suggestions to help or assist the user solve the error. Error codes are displayed to the user when internal errors or server errors occur, regardless of what the cause of the error is.  
10. **Help and documentation -**
There's a dedicated search page, but could only be accessed from the error page. The search bar has a limit of characters, forcing users to enter between 4 and 30 characters.
<br>
## Performance

It takes more than 10 seconds to fully load the website on the desktop. Video files and iframes are among the main reasons for this low speed index. It could have been avoided by lazy-loading the multimedia files, but instead, it shows the user a blank screen, since it loads the whole page all at once. It takes more than 15 seconds for the homepage to be fully interactive on a mobile device. The page-load is not at all reliable or fast enough on mobile networks as there's no proper caching technique used within the website.
